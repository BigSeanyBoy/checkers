# Checkers

This project consists of a checkers engine and an AI for the user to play against. The AI utilizes the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and progressive deepening to select moves. The heuristic used to evaluate the board state is designed to reward aggressive play by taking the ratio of remaining pieces from each player.
